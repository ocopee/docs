	\section{Introduction}
	"Now there are many directions of development. Most are plans, strategies or are in the process of being tested. But there is one thing I have said over and over again: There are only two sectors that are the future of the Vietnamese economy: the Information Technology sector and the Agriculture sector." - PhD. Alan Phan
	\subsection{Problem}
	Start-up innovation in agriculture and handicrafts approach a new customer hardly. 
	One of the most highly effective channels is Expo Center.
	However, if some environmental reasons prevent an expo from being held, maybe there is no alternative.
	\subsection{Orientation}
	OCOPEE was extended from a classic e-commerce platform to bring a user experience from a usual expo to an online expo. Although it is difficult, it is also an opportunity to help the traditional form of fairs no longer be limited geographically.
	\section{Analysic}
	\subsection{Resources of the system}
	There are some resources that are necessary to create value for the customer.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Real-time, live-stream system.
		\item Interaction as a social network.
		\item Customer data.
	\end{itemize}
	\subsection{Goals}
	 The most important activities in executing a system's value proposition.
		\begin{itemize}
		\item Community standards, agency policy.
		\item User behavior tracking.
		\item Customer care.
		\item Display shop, product,...
		\item Events, viewer behavior, comments, reactions,...
	\end{itemize}
	\subsection{Features}
	The featues, screens, functions need implement.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Affiliate marketing for this system can generate a link. The help system can keep track of which customers are invited by the agent.
		\item Register to participate in expo. 
		\item E-commerce function.
		\item Live-stream for business.
		\item Current views counting for shop, product.
		\item Reactions, Comments.
		\item Send quick question in current expo.
	\end{itemize}
	\section{Technology}

	\subsection{Client Architecture}
	Micro-frontend, one single page, server side render.
